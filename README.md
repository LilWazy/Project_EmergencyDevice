  üöë Emergency Device for Mountain Climbers who experienced accident! ‚õ∞Ô∏è

## About
This project is an emergency communication device that is able to send emergency messages that include location such as Altitude, Longitude, and Latitude. So the location of the mountaineers can be known refer to the data. This project using LoRa (long range) technology, GPS (global positioning system) and Telegram.

Here's the reason why this device was created:
* When climbers experience accidents or obstacles, they cannot directly contact the rescue team using cell phones because telephone signals are not always available on the mountain
* Climbers will ask for help by visiting the registration post at the foot of the mountain, which takes time
* Emergency communication device is needed that can send emergency messages to the rescue team
  
Hopefully with this emergency communication device can solve the problems that have been mentioned, so it can speeding up the evacuation process and increasing the safety of mountain climbers who experience obstacles or accidents in remote areas.
I know this project has a lot of deficiency in both hardware and software but in order to develop this project to be better, I am looking forward to the input and criticism of this project üòÅ
